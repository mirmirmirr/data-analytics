## Train and evaluate 2 kNN models using the abalone dataset
## Each model should use a different subset of features

## Compare models using contingency tables
## Find the optimal value k for the better performing model from above by
## training over a range of k values and choosing the value with the
## highest accuracy (accuracy = correct classifications / total observations)
